Hi there! 👋
I'm a first-year engineering student passionate about learning, coding, and creating. I love exploring new technologies and continuously expanding my skills. I'm still in the early stages of my journey, but I'm excited to collaborate and contribute to projects as I learn more.

Feel free to check out my repositories and follow along as I grow in the world of development. Let's build something amazing together!
